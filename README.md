# Airline Booking System

A console-based Airline Booking System built using Java, demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a simple flight reservation system where users can:

- View all available flights
- Search for flights based on source and destination
- Book a flight by providing passenger details
- Cancel existing bookings
- View their bookings using a unique identifier (passport number)

The system ensures seat availability is tracked and maintains data consistency between bookings and flights.

## Key Features

- **Menu-driven interface:** Easy-to-use console-based interaction.
- **Flight management:** Tracks total and available seats for each flight.
- **Passenger management:** Handles passenger information and booking details.
- **Booking and cancellation:** Supports creating and canceling bookings with seat updates.
- **Search functionality:** Allows users to find flights by source and destination.
- **OOP Concepts:** Utilizes abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Technologies Used

- Java (Console application)
- Java Collections (ArrayList, Iterator)
- Date handling for booking timestamps
